The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the `snapshot.exists` check.  For example, attempting to access `snapshot.data().name` when `snapshot.exists` is false will result in a runtime error. This frequently occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations and expecting data before the promise resolves.
